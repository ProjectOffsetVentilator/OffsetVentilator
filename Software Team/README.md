## Software
Ventsense - utility for logging pressure and temperature data from BMP-388 sensor. Consists of firmware to run on 
an Arduino Uno (ventsense_fw), as well as software to run on a host PC connected to the Arduino by a USB cable 
(ventsense_client). The ventsense firmware interfaces with up to 3 BMP-388 chips and streams their data over serial 
at a 10 Hz rate. The ventsense client receives the data over serial and logs it to a Comma-Seperated Value (.csv) file.
